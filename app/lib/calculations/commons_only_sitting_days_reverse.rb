    # # A method for calculating the start date for delegated legislation laid into the House of Commons only, taking account of sitting days.
    # The calculation counts a day whenever the House of Commons has an actual sitting day - and requires the start date and the number of days to count.
    # The calculation is set out in [section 5 (4A) of the Planning Act 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/29/section/5#section-5-4A).
