    # # A method for calculating the start date for treaty periods A and B.
    # The calculation counts a day whenever both Houses have an actual sitting day - and requires the start date and the number of days to count.
    # For period A the start date is the day on which "a Minister of the Crown has laid before Parliament a copy of the treaty".
    # For period B the start date is the day on which "a Minister of the Crown has laid before Parliament a statement indicating that the Minister is of the opinion that the treaty should nevertheless be ratified and explaining why".
    # The calculation is defined by Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 section 20 paragraphs [2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2#section-20-2), [5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2#section-20-5) and [9](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2#section-20-9).
