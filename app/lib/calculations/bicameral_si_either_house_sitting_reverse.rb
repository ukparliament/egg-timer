    # # A method for calculating the start date of a scrutiny period, based on days on which **either** House must be sitting or on a short adjournment.
    # This method is used for bicameral negative Statutory Instruments as set out by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 and for made affirmative Statutory Instruments as set out by their enabling Act.
    # The calculation is set out in [paragraph 1 Section 7 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-1), though a different calculation may be required if the instrument is laid under another Act - as per [paragraph 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-3).
    # This method is also used for calculations of scrutiny periods for proposed draft remedial orders and draft affirmative remedial orders and for scrutiny and approval periods for made affirmative remedial orders as set out in [Schedule 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/2#schedule-2).
    # The calculation counts in actual sitting days, requiring the start date and the number of days to count.
