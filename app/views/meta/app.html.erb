<p>This website generates JSON output for the calculation of scrutiny dates. This JSON can be called for and parsed outside a web browser.</p>

<p>Here's <a href='/egg-timer/egg-timer.app.zip'>an example application for MacOS, just called 'Egg Timer'</a>, that calls the JSON endpoint and displays the result.</p>

<p>This is an 'unsigned' application, written without an Apple developer account. If you'd like to open the application, please follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac">the instructions from Apple</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Finder  on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.</li>
<li>Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.</li>
<li>Click Open.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please remember that this is only demonstration code - and not intended to be used in production.</p>

<p>The application is written in Xojo.</p>
