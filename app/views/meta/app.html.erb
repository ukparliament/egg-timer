	<h2>Demonstration MacOS application</h2>

	<p>This website generates JSON output for the calculation of scrutiny dates. This JSON can be called for and parsed outside a web browser.</p>

	<p>Here's <a href='/egg-timer/egg-timer.app.zip'>an example application for MacOS, just called 'Egg Timer'</a>, that calls the JSON endpoint and displays the result.</p>


	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>This is an 'unsigned' application, written without an Apple developer account. If you'd like to open the application, please follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac">the instructions from Apple</a>:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>In the Finder  on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.</li>
	<li>Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.</li>
	<li>Click Open.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>How to use the application</h2>

	<p>The Egg Timer application will calculate a scrutiny date whenever the information used for the calculation is changed.</p>

	<p>The 'anticipated scrutiny end date' will be recalculated when you click on a new procedure, when you select a new date in the calendar picker, or when you change the number of days required to count.</p>
