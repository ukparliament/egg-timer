<h2>Creating appointments</h2>


	<p>You can create <strong>a single day, full day appointment</strong>: the application will mark a single day.</p>
	<p>You can create <strong>a timed appointment on a single day</strong>: the application will mark a single day.</p>
	
	
	
	
		<p>You can create <strong>a multi-day all day appointment</strong>: the application will mark all included days as a single 'day'. For sitting days, this would allow us to create sittings that span dates. If you want to create individual days, you should create a single day, full day appointment.</p>
	<p>You can create <strong>a timed, part day appointment across more than one day</strong>: the application will mark all included days as a single 'day'. For sitting days, this would allow us to create sittings that span dates and have times. If you want to create individual days, you should create a single day, full day appointment.</p>
	
	
	<p>When entering sitting days, do not create multi-day appointments unless a sitting day extends over more than one calendar day and wipes out the next dayâ€™s scheduled sitting.</p>
	<p>Creating multi-day appointments for individual sitting days creates a single sitting day spanning those dates. For the purposes of calculating some types of scrutiny period this would be counted as a single parliamentary sitting day and return an incorrect estimated end date.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>You can create <strong>a multi-day all day appointment</strong>. For adjournment days, these will be split into individual days in the application. For sitting and virtual sitting days, these will not be split - the application will mark all included days as a single 'day'. This allows us to create sittings that span dates. If you want to create individual sitting days, you should create a single day, full day appointment.</p>
	
	<p>You can create <strong>a timed, part day appointment across more than one day</strong>. For adjournment days, these will be split into individual days in the application. For sitting and virtual sitting days, these will not be split - the application will mark all included days as a single 'day'. This allows us to create sittings that span dates and have times. If you want to create individual sitting days, you should create a single day, full day appointment.</p>
	
	
	<p>You can create <strong>a set of individual days as a recurring appointment</strong>: the application will mark single days.</p>
	
	<p>Days during periods of <strong>prorogation or dissolution should be left blank on the calendar</strong>. The Houses can only be adjourned during a session.</p>
