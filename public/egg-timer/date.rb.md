# A monkey patched Ruby date class to handle UK Parliament specific day types.

class Date
## A set of methods to work out the type of a given day.

### We want to check if this is an actual sitting day in the Commons.

We use a naive definition of a sitting day: this includes a calendar day when the Commons sits, together with following calendar days if the Commons sat through the night.

For example: if the Commons sat on a Tuesday and continued to sit overnight into Wednesday, both Tuesday and Wednesday would count as actual sitting days. 

If the Tuesday sitting lasted long enough to overlap the starting time of the Wednesday sitting, the Tuesday would be a parliamentary sitting day, but the Wednesday would not.

  def is_commons_actual_sitting_day?
    SittingDay.all.where( 'start_date <= ?',  self ).where( 'end_date >= ?',  self ).where( house_id: 1 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is an actual sitting day in the Lords.

We use a naive definition of a sitting day: this includes a calendar day when the Lords sits, together with following calendar days if the Lords sat through the night.

For example: if the Lords sat on a Tuesday and continued to sit overnight into Wednesday, both Tuesday and Wednesday would count as actual sitting days.

If the Tuesday sitting lasted long enough to overlap the starting time of the Wednesday sitting, the Tuesday would be a parliamentary sitting day, but the Wednesday would not.

  def is_lords_actual_sitting_day?
    SittingDay.all.where( 'start_date <= ?',  self ).where( 'end_date >= ?',  self ).where( house_id: 2 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is a parliamentary sitting day in the Commons. 

We use a more strict definition of a sitting day. We don’t include dates for which the Commons continued sitting from a previous day, where the preceding day’s sitting overlapped with the next day’s programmed sitting.

  def is_commons_parliamentary_sitting_day?
    SittingDay.all.where( 'start_date = ?',  self ).where( house_id: 1 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is a parliamentary sitting day in the Lords.

We use a more strict definition of a sitting day. We don’t include dates for which the Lords continued sitting from a previous day, where the preceding day’s sitting overlapped with the next day’s programmed sitting.

  def is_lords_parliamentary_sitting_day?
    SittingDay.all.where( 'start_date = ?',  self ).where( house_id: 2 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is a virtual sitting day in the Commons.

This is a day where all Members of the House sit ‘digitally’, rather than physically.

A virtual sitting may continue over more than one calendar day. We count any continuation, where the preceding day’s sitting overlapped with the next day’s programmed sitting, as also being a virtual sitting day.

As of the end of June 2020, the Commons has had no virtual sitting days.

  def is_commons_virtual_sitting_day?
    VirtualSittingDay.all.where( 'start_date <= ?',  self ).where( 'end_date >= ?',  self ).where( house_id: 1 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is a virtual sitting day in the Lords.

This is a day where all Members of the House sit ‘digitally’, rather than physically.

A virtual sitting may continue over more than one calendar day. We count any continuation, where the preceding day’s sitting overlapped with the next day’s programmed sitting, as also being a virtual sitting day.

  def is_lords_virtual_sitting_day?

### We want to check if this is an actual sitting day in *either* House.

  def is_either_house_actual_sitting_day?
    self.is_commons_actual_sitting_day? or self.is_lords_actual_sitting_day?
  end
### We want to check if this is an actual sitting day in *both* Houses.

  def is_joint_actual_sitting_day?
    self.is_commons_actual_sitting_day? and self.is_lords_actual_sitting_day?
  end
### We want to check if this is a parliamentary sitting day in *either* House.

  def is_either_house_parliamentary_sitting_day?

  def is_joint_parliamentary_sitting_day?
    self.is_commons_parliamentary_sitting_day? and self.is_lords_parliamentary_sitting_day?
  end
### We want to check if this is an adjournment day in either House.

  def is_adjournment_day?
    AdjournmentDay.all.where( 'date = ?',  self ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is an adjournment day in the Commons.

  def is_commons_adjournment_day?
    AdjournmentDay.all.where( 'date = ?',  self ).where( house_id: 1 ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is an adjournment day in the Lords.

  def is_lords_adjournment_day?
    AdjournmentDay.all.where( 'date = ?',  self ).where( house_id: 2 ).first
  end
### We want to check if Parliament is prorogued on this day.

  def is_prorogation_day?
    ProrogationDay.all.where( 'date = ?',  self ).first
  end
### We want to check if Parliament is dissolved on this day.

  def is_dissolution_day?
    DissolutionDay.all.where( 'date = ?',  self ).first
  end
### We want to check if this is a day for which we have something in the calendar.

That may be an actual sitting day - including parliamentary sitting days, a virtual sitting day, an adjournment day, a day within prorogation or a day within dissolution.

  def is_calendar_populated?
    self.is_commons_actual_sitting_day? or self.is_lords_actual_sitting_day? or self.is_commons_virtual_sitting_day? or self.is_lords_virtual_sitting_day? or self.is_adjournment_day? or self.is_prorogation_day? or self.is_dissolution_day?
  end
### We want to check if this is a day for which we do not have anything in the calendar.

We use this to check if we've "run out of calendar" so we don't keep cycling into future days and loop infinitely.

This is our event horizon.

  def is_calendar_not_populated?
    !self.is_calendar_populated?
  end
### Methods to calculate non-sitting scrutiny days in both Houses.

In [guidance issued on 16-04-2020](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/688/documents/33426/default/) the Lords Procedure Committee stated, "A Virtual Proceeding is not a sitting of the House."

Whilst clerks state that a virtual sitting day does not count as a sitting day for the purposes of calculating scrutiny periods, lawyers imply this would need to be tested in court.

Unless and until this is resolved, these methods use the clerks' definition of non-sitting scrutiny day.

### We want to check if this is a non-sitting scrutiny day in the Commons.

During a short adjournment, adjournment days count toward the scrutiny period.

This method allows the definition of a “short” adjournment to be adjusted by passing in a maximum day count.

In all known cases “short” is defined as not more than four days.

For the purposes of calculating non-sitting scrutiny days, virtual sitting days also count.

  def is_commons_non_sitting_scrutiny_day?( maximum_day_count )
#### We want to check if this is a Commons adjournnment day or a Commons virtual sitting day.

    if self.is_commons_adjournment_day? or self.is_commons_virtual_sitting_day?
Having found that this is a Commons adjournnment day or a Commons virtual sitting day, we start the adjournment day count at 1.

      end
If the total number of continuous non-sitting scrutiny days is more than the maximum day count ...

... then this day does not count as a non-sitting scrutiny day.

        is_commons_non_sitting_scrutiny_day = false
If the total number of continuous non-sitting scrutiny days is less than or the same as the maximum day count ...

      else
... then this day does count as a non-sitting scrutiny day.

        is_commons_non_sitting_scrutiny_day = true

    if self.is_lords_adjournment_day? or self.is_lords_virtual_sitting_day?
Having found that this is a Lords adjournnment day or a Lords virtual sitting day, we start the adjournment day count at 1.

(End of methods to calculate non-sitting scrutiny days in both Houses.)

### We want to check if this is a scrutiny day in the Commons.

A scrutiny day in the Commons is either an actual sitting day in the Commons, or a non-sitting scrutiny day in the Commons.

We pass '4' as the maximum day count to the non-sitting scrutiny day calculation, because non-sitting scrutiny days are days within a series of not more than four non-sitting days.

  def is_commons_scrutiny_day?
    self.is_commons_actual_sitting_day? or self.is_commons_non_sitting_scrutiny_day?( 4 )
  end
### We want to check if this is a scrutiny day in the Lords.

A scrutiny day in the Lords is either an actual sitting day in the Lords, or a non-sitting scrutiny day in the Lords.

We pass '4' as the maximum day count to the non-sitting scrutiny day calculation, because  non-sitting scrutiny days are days within a series of not more than four non-sitting days.

(End of set of methods to work out the type of a given day.)

## A set of methods to find the first day of a given type.

### We want to find the first scrutiny day in *either* House.

This method is used when a Statutory Instrument is laid outside of a scrutiny period, that is: during a non-sitting period of more than four days, or during a period in which Parliament is prorogued. In such cases, the clock starts from the first actual sitting day in either House following the laying.

This method is used for bicameral negative SIs - and bicameral made affirmatives where the enabling legislation specifies that either House can be sitting.

  def first_scrutiny_day_in_either_house
If this is a day on which the calendar is not yet populated ...

    if self.is_calendar_not_populated?
... then we cannot find a first scrutiny day so we stop looking.

... then return this day as the first scrutiny day in either House.

        self
      end
    end
  end
### We want to find the first scrutiny day in *both* Houses.

This method is used when a Statutory Instrument is laid outside of a scrutiny period, that is: during an adjournment of more than four days, or during a period in which Parliament is prorogued. The clock starts from the first actual sitting day in both Houses following the laying.

This method is used for bicameral made affirmatives where the enabling legislation specifies that both Houses must be sitting.

### We want to find the first scrutiny day in the Commons.

This method is used when a Statutory Instrument is laid outside of a scrutiny period, that is: during an adjournment of more than four days, or during a period in which Parliament is prorogued. The clock starts from the first actual sitting day in the Commons following the laying.

This method is used for negative or made affirmative SIs - laid in the Commons and not laid in the Lords.

... then return this day as the first scrutiny day in the Commons.

        self
      end
    end
  end
### We want to find the first parliamentary sitting day in both Houses.

This method is used when a Proposed Negative Statutory Instrument is laid.

Even if a PNSI is laid on a joint parliamentary sitting day, the clock does not start until the next joint parliamentary sitting day.

  def first_joint_parliamentary_sitting_day
If this is a day on which the calendar is not yet populated ...

        self
      end
    end
  end
### We want to find the first actual sitting day in both Houses.

This method is used to calculate periods A and B for treaties.

Even if a treaty is laid or a ministerial statement is made on a joint actual sitting day, the clock does not start until the next joint actual sitting day.

  def first_joint_actual_sitting_day
If this is a day on which the calendar is not yet populated ...

    if self.is_calendar_not_populated?

## A set of methods to return which higher level parliamentary time periods a calendar day sits in.

A calendar day may sit in either a dissolution period or a Parliament period.

If a calendar day sits inside a Parliament period, it may sit inside either a session or a dissolution period.

### We want to find which dissolution period a calendar day sits in, if any.
