</pre></code><h1>A method for calculating the end date of scrutiny periods during which <strong>both</strong> Houses must be sitting or on a short adjournment, used for made affirmative Statutory Instruments as set out by their enabling Act. Also used for Legislative Reform Orders, Public Body Orders and Localism Orders.</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-1">Paragraph 1 of section 7 of the Statutory Instrument Act 1946</a> sets out that - in calculating the scrutiny period for an SI under that Act - “no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which <em>both</em> Houses are adjourned for more than four days.” This applies to the majority of made affirmative instruments.</p>
<p>Made affirmatives laid under different Acts follow other rules, for example: <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/7/section/5/enacted#section-5-9">paragraph 9 of section 5 of the National Insurance Contributions Act 2014</a>, sets out that “no account is to be taken of any time [..] during which either House is adjourned for more than 4 days.&quot;</p>
<p>This calculation deals with the case where days are not counted if <em>either</em> House is adjourned for more than four days.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time periods for Legislative Reform Orders are set out in sections <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/51/section/18#section-18">18</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/51/section/19#section-19">19</a> of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for Public Body Orders are set out in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/24/section/11#section-11-12">paragraph 12 of section 11 of the Public Bodies Act 2011</a>.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for Localism Orders are set out in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/enacted#section-19-14">paragraph 14 of section 19 of the Localism Act 2011</a>.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for published drafts are set out in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/8/enacted#schedule-8-paragraph-14">paragraph 14 of schedule 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018</a>.</p>

</pre></code><h2>We start counting on the <strong>first day both Houses have a scrutiny day</strong>.</h2>
<p>For Legislative Reform Orders, Public Body Orders and Localism Orders this will be the day on which the instrument was laid, if that day was a scrutiny day.</p>
<p>For published drafts under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, this will be the day on which the draft was published, if that day was a scrutiny day. This is set out in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/8/enacted#schedule-8-paragraph-14-2">paragraph 14(2) of Schedule 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 </a>.</p>
<p>For made affimatives this will be the day on which the instrument was made, if that day was a scrutiny day.</p>
<p>For instruments covered by this calculation, lacking explicit instructions in enabling Acts, we decide to take the definition from <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/5#section-5-1">paragraph 1 of section 5 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946</a>.</p>
